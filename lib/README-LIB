In order to get the Eclipse project to build correctly, you need to add the 
scalatest jar in this folder. This can be done using any http download tool
such as wget or curl. 

LINUX:
  cd <path-to-lms>/virtualization-lms-core/lib
  wget -O scalatest.jar http://dl.dropbox.com/u/...

MAC:
  cd <path-to-lms>/virtualization-lms-core/lib
  curl -o scalatest.jar http://dl.dropbox.com/u/...

WINDOWS:
  Manually download http://dl.dropbox.com/u/...
  and place it in the lib folder.
